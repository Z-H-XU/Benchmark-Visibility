Thank you very much for your attention to our work!

These challenges make it difficult for researchers to develop accurate and efficient methods for traffic visibility estimation from traffic video frames.  Therefore, this study aims to establish the first benchmark for quantifying the visibility of traffic roads using video networks.


 If you use the dataset or the code, please kindly cite the following paper:  Zhihuo Xu, Yyuexia Wang, Linyi Zhou,  et al., First Visibility Sensing Benchmark for Intelligent Transportation Systems using Traffic Video Networks: Dataset and Methodology.
