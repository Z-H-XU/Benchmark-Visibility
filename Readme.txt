Thank you for your attention to our work!

There has been very limited research on estimating visibility from video frames, primarily due to the lack of high-quality data and accurate ground truth annotations. Moreover, visibility estimation from video frames is a challenging task and falls under the category of NP hard problems. These inherent difficulties make it challenging for researchers to develop accurate and efficient methods for traffic visibility estimation from traffic video frames. Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish the first benchmark for quantifying the visibility of traffic roads using video networks.
